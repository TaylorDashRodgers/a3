- A3 - The Cabin In The Woods
- This program generates a 3D environment with a ground plan across the XZ plane
where my hero is draw to and can be moved around and looked at with an ArcballCam.
- How to run the program is to compile and run the code after updating the CmakeLists
correctly and once it is running you can move the hero forward or backward in its
heading using w or s in that order. You can also change the rotation of the hero
with the keys a and d to turn him left or right. To change the camera you just use
the mouse left click and dragging to rotate it. To zoom in you just hold shift and
drag up or down with the mouse left click. I used the ArcballCam class as reference
for this.
- This assignment took me probably about 12 hours but a lot of that was trying to
change what I needed to change from the Lab05 as my source code before really
getting going.
- The lab really helped me for this assignment 8.
- This assignment was super fun and cool, and I would give it a 10.
